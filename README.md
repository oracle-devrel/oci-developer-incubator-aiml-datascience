## Introduction
This repository provides AI&ML use case with 6 different deployment paths for you to choose from based on your preference and requirements. As each path comes with its own benefits, refer to the table below to guide you in making an informed decision.

| Benefits | DIY | Mix & Match | Managed |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Use a GPU shape for deep-learning model training and inference or CPU-based compute for machine learning, according to your needs | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: | :white_check_mark: |
